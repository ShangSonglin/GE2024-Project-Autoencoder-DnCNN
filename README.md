# AutoDnCNN-Image-Denoising

## Introduction
This is an in-class research project on image denoising. Image denoising is an important problem in digital image processing, especially when noise is added to an image, which affects its quality. This project studies the method of image denoising using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared to traditional denoising techniques, CNNs can automatically learn from data how to remove noise from images, showing better flexibility and effectiveness.

## Types of Noise
We explored several common types of noise and the performance of CNNs in dealing with these noises:
- **Gaussian Noise**
- **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**

Additionally, this project analyzed the effectiveness of the models in handling uncertain types of noise (such as real noise or hybrid noise) under different scenarios.

## Experimental Results
Through the experimental results, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the CNN approach and compared the performance of different models.

## Conclusion
This project provides a foundation for future image-denoising research and discusses possible directions for improvement.

## Future Work
- Explore more advanced CNN architectures for denoising.
- Investigate the performance of CNNs on larger and more diverse datasets.
- Develop methods to handle real-world noise more effectively.
