# DnCNN-Image-Denoising
an inclass research project
Image denoising is an important problem in digital image processing, especially when noise is added to an image, which affects its quality. This paper studies the method of image denoising using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared to traditional denoising techniques, CNNs can automatically learn from data how to remove noise from images, showing better flexibility and effectiveness. 
We explored several common types of noise (such as Gaussian noise and salt-and-pepper noise) and the performance of CNNs in dealing with these noises. Additionally, this paper analyzed the effectiveness of the models in handling uncertain types of noise (such as real noise or hybrid noise) under different scenarios. Through the experimental results, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the CNN approach and compared the performance of different models. 
This paper provides a foundation for future image-denoising research and discusses possible directions for improvement.
